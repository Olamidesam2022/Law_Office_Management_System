# 📖 Law Office Management Web Application

## 📝 Introduction

This project is a **Law Office Management Web Application** developed as part of a comprehensive school project. The primary goal of this system is to **digitally transform legal office operations** by enabling lawyers, paralegals, and administrative staff to manage clients, cases, appointments, and legal documents in a **secure, user-friendly, and efficient manner**.

Traditionally, many law offices rely on manual record-keeping methods, such as physical files and ledgers. While these methods have worked for decades, they are prone to errors, loss, and inefficiencies. This project aims to showcase how **modern technology (React, Vite, Firebase)** can be leveraged to digitize and automate legal operations while ensuring data security and accessibility.

This README provides an **extensive and detailed explanation** of the project. It includes the purpose, objectives, features, technical implementation, installation steps, usage guide, and areas for future development. This makes it a **comprehensive school project documentation** that demonstrates both technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

## 🧩 Example Utility Functions (with Explanations)

Below are some simple utility functions used throughout the project, with code samples and explanations:

```js
// Formats a JavaScript Date object or timestamp to "DD MMM YYYY"
function formatDate(date) {
  const d = new Date(date);
  return d.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
    day: "2-digit",
    month: "short",
    year: "numeric",
  });
